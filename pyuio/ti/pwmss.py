    # It is not really clear to me whether the modules do anything with a clock
    # stop request other than immediately acknowledging it.  At least QEP seems
    # to remain fully operational while clock stop is requested and acked.
    #
    # The kernel code for this never bothers with clock stop request and only
    # uses clkreq values 0 and 1 (without bothering to even check clkack).
    #
    # When a submodule's clock is disabled, any attempt to access its registers
    # doesn't merely result in a bus error but also seems to result in death of
    # the whole subsystem, rendering it unusable.  (Most likely what's happening
    # is that the request is passed to the module even though it's not clocked,
    # eventually resulting in a timeout by the L4 target agent.  This means it
    # may be recoverable by clearing the error in the target agent... I'll try
    # that when I find the time.)
