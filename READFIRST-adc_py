adc.py allows you to monitor and write to registers defined by a dictionary object

use arrow keys to move around, use the enter key to 1) start making changes and 2) confirm changes.

use 'c' to cancel changes.

use 'q' to quit.

it is rough around the edges- you SHOULD run it in a terminal large enough to support all registers mapped by the dictionary.
if full screen isn't good enough, then you need to make your font smaller.

it reorders the registers EVERY TIME YOU RUN IT.
